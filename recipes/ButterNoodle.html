    <h1>Buttered Noodles</h1>
    <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan 
       cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs 
       and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve 
       either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious 
       recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

    <h2>Buttered Noodles Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, you can make this incredibly simple dish with just four
       ingredients:</p>
       
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any 
                noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at 
                the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of 
                course).</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered 
                noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong> Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and
                ground black pepper.</li>
          </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
